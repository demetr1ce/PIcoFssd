# PIcoFssd
PIco + Raspberry Pi 3 + Windows IoT

This was adapted from https://github.com/modmypi/PiModules/blob/master/code/python/upspico/picofssd/scripts/picofssd and is very bare bones, but should help get anyone trying to pair the  UPS PIco (http://www.pimodules.com/_pdf/_pico/UPS_PIco_BL_FSSD_V1.0.pdf) with a Raspberry Pi 3 using Windows IoT. Feel free to add on/improve/use as you see fit.
